# Discrete dipole approximation
Develop your own Discrete dipole approximation algorithm.

See eg: "Discrete-dipole approximation for scattering calculations", B. T. Draine and P. J. Flatau, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, Vol. 11, No. 4, 1491, (April 1994)

The purpose of this code was to be able to approximate some geometry as a lattice of polarized dipoles to solve scattering, abosrption, etc. problems. We should use the complex conjugate gradient algorithm to solve reuslting linear equations of this.

Unforuntaley I could not figure it out. I was having trouble with understanding the complex conjugate gradient algoirthm to implement. And also struggled to figure out the whole lattice thing and how the elements relate to eachother and get a position vector. But I can get Ajk elements so that's good. I think the docstrings explain how to use the function(s).

Unforuntately don't really have anything to unit test
